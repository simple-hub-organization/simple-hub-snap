summary: Hub to control smart device from different vendors with one app.
description: |
  CyBear Jinni Hub to control smart devices from different vendors with one easy-to-use app.

  It is an open-source Hub that keeps your data local by default.

  The Hub will extend the devices basic functionality by acting as a leader and sending signals
  to the devices according to the logic you set it to be.

  The functionality will include activating routines, saving different scense, binding devices so
  that action in one device will trigger other actions in different devices and more.

  You can control the Hub from your android phone

  For the hub to work please install MQTT broker https://snapcraft.io/mosquitto and configure it to be open for requests.

  If you have any questions you can ask in the CyBear Jinni discord server https://discord.gg/mUXfwUY.

grade: stable  # devel/stable, must be 'stable' to release into candidate/stable channels
confinement: strict  # devmode/classic/strict, use 'strict' once you have the right plugs and slots
